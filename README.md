🎯Hey there, I’m Adnan — glad you stopped by!

I’m a Computer Science undergrad (2022–2026) with a knack for turning bold ideas into real-world solutions.
As a GeeksforGeeks Campus Mantri and Youth Leader at Young Indians, I thrive at the intersection of technology, leadership, and social impact.

💻 What you’ll find here:

🚀 Projects in Python, JavaScript, ML, and Cloud

📊 Data-driven dashboards & smart tools

🌱 Tech-for-good initiatives that aim to make a difference

🏆 A little about my journey so far:

12× Paper Presentation Winner across state and National events.

Built an AI-based disaster prediction model to improve early warning systems.

Led student communities & represented my college at national innovation forums.

✨ Fun fact: I believe technology is not just a tool — it’s a catalyst for change.
Here on GitHub, you’ll see my experiments, my learning curve, and my small steps toward building something meaningful.

So let’s code, collaborate, and create impact together 💻🤝
You bring the coffee, I’ll bring the commits ☕💻
