## üéØHey there, I‚Äôm Syed Adnan Ahmed ‚Äî glad you stopped by!

I‚Äôm a Computer Science undergrad (2022‚Äì2026) who loves turning big ideas into real things that matter. As a GeeksforGeeks Campus Mantri and Youth Leader with Young Indians, I don‚Äôt just code, I also lead, collaborate and push for tech that makes a difference.

I‚Äôve learned that the best solutions come from teamwork, curiosity, and a bit of grit. Whether I‚Äôm building AI models to predict disasters or organizing student communities, I‚Äôm driven by the goal to create something meaningful, not just impressive.

At the core, I believe leadership means serving others, and innovation means solving real challenges. So I‚Äôm here to keep learning, keep building, and keep making an impact that is one project, one talk, and one connection at a time.

## üíª What you‚Äôll find here:

üíª Projects in web development, AI chatbots, machine learning, and cloud solutions.

üìä Data-driven dashboards & smart tools.

üå± Tech-for-good initiatives that aim to make a difference.
